"REQUIIRES OPENAI API KEY TO USE AND MOUNTING YOUR GOOGLE DRIVE. WHY? SO YOU DON'T SPEND MONEY GENERATING IMAGES AND LOOSING THEM WHEN YOU CLOSE THE NOTEBOOK."

This is some boilerplate code for use with the openai api, with a bit of some extras that you can run for free in a google colab notebook.

It uses GPT-3.5-Turbo-16k and can be changed to other models as well.

I think the rest is pretty self explanatory. But, if you have any questions, feel free to message me directly. Enjoy!
